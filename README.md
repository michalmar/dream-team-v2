# Build your dream team with Autogen

This repository leverages Microsoft Autogen 0.4, Azure OpenAI and integrates it with Streamlit, to build an end to end multi agents application, this repo makes it easy to build test and deploy an advanced multi agent framework, based on [Magentic One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/)
 

![Architecture](assets/architecture.png)

:tada: January 11, 2025: The repo now support [Autogen 0.4.0 stable version](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/)

:tada: December 3, 2024: The repo now support one click deployment with [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/), if you would like to run it with the full process localy you can check [v0.21](https://github.com/yanivvak/dream-team/tree/v0.21)

:tada: November 18, 2024: we are porting this repo to  [Autogen 0.4](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.4.0.dev6/index.html), A new event driven, asynchronous architecture for AutoGen and [Magentic One](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one)

# Key Features

Dream Team offers the following key features:

- **Advanced multi agent framework**: this solution is based on the popular framework Autogen(35K stars) and Magentic One
- **Friendly UI**: easy way to build and share data apps powered by React / Vite.js / Tailwind / Shadcn
- **Single line deployment**: developer-friendly deployment that accelerates your path from a local development environment to Azure with single line of code - azd up.
- **Secure code execution**:  Fast access to secure sandboxed with strong isolation environments that are ideal for running code or applications with Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions.
- **Managed Identities**: Built in Azure Managed identities to eliminate the need for developers to manage these credentials
- **Observability & Debugging**: Built-in features and tools for tracking, tracing, and debugging agent interactions and workflows, including PromptFlow tracing.


# Prerequisites:

1. Install [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows).
2. Ensure you have access to an Azure subscription
3. Docker - Follow the [official Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - make sure your docker is loged in (docker login -u "username" -p "password"
 )
4. Python version >= 3.10, < 3.13
5. Install [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) - optional for running locally


# Step by step deployment
   
## 1. Clone the repository     
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dream-team  
```
## 2. Login to your Azure account
```bash
azd auth login
```
> You need to choose your preferred region (you can start with east us or sweden central or any other available region)
## 3. Deploy Azure Resources and the app
```bash
azd up
```

# Notes 

- while using Web Surfer agent, you might want to change Content Safety on Azure OpenAI to accomodate your needs
- currently it is "bring your own AI Search" (BYOS) - since its assuming you have your own search engine, we are working on a solution to make it easier for you
   - you must add two ENV variables to backend service to connect to your search engine
   - `AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` - your search engine endpoint
   - `AZURE_SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY` - your search engine key (we are working to enable managed identity for this service)
 

# Working locally  

There are two parts to this project: the backend and the frontend. The backend is written in Python, and the frontend is written in JavaScript using React.

## Backend

```bash  
cd backend  
```
Set up a virtual environment (Preferred)
```bash
uv venv
```
Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.

On Windows, run:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Unix or MacOS, run:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
To deactivate :
```bash
deactivate
```
> More information about virtual environments can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

### Install dependencies
```bash
uv sync
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Update configuration

   - If you used AZD to deploy the resources just run the code below
   ```bash
   azd env get-values > .env
   ```` 
   - Alternatively, copy `.env.sample` (under backend) into `.env`

> Important: Magentic-One code uses code execution, you need to have Docker installed to run the examples if you use local execution

### Run
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
```
### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### Update configuration

Change `env.local`
```bash
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_ACTIVATON_CODE=
VITE_ALLWAYS_LOGGED_IN=true
```

## Run
```bash
npm run dev
```
If your app is ready, you can browse to (typically) http://localhost:8501 to see the app in action.
